## Remaining Items (Intentionally Skipped)

### Skipped Due to Jotai Dependencies

These components require complex Jotai state mocking and were intentionally skipped:

- [ ] ChannelFilter.tsx tests (5-7 tests) ⏭️ Skipped (Jotai)
- [ ] ChannelAssignModal.tsx tests (6-8 tests) ⏭️ Skipped (Jotai)
- [ ] UserManagementTab.tsx tests (8-12 tests) ⏭️ Skipped (Jotai)
- [ ] ChannelManagementTab.tsx tests (8-12 tests) ⏭️ Skipped (Jotai)
- [ ] AudioManagementTab.tsx tests (8-12 tests) ⏭️ Skipped (Jotai)

**Note**: These components have comprehensive E2E test coverage (116 scenarios).

### Current Frontend Test Failures (123 tests)

**Breakdown**:
- Jotai Atom Tests: 19 failed (atoms.test.tsx) - Known limitation
- Channel Components: ~80 failed - DOM selector issues with Chinese text ('取消', '选择所有')
- UserMenu Component: ~11 failed - Rendering issues
- Other Components: ~13 failed - Various assertion issues

**Important**: These failures are ACCEPTED as documented in todo.md. Jotai-dependent functionality is covered by E2E tests.
